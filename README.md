# EWMA Sales Data Regression Report
A multiple linear regression analysis of sales data for a souvenir shop in Queensland. Uses data to create time-series models for three different EWMA methods. After model fitting, and an analysis of metrics, we perform forecasting based on the model fittings. Justification and the walkthrough of methods can be found in the Regression Report pdf and the R codes used can be found in the text file.
